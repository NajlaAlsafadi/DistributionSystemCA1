Create a web application that uses a Java REST Library of your choice, along with Hibernate, to implement the following functionality:

•	You are required to write a REST API using a JAX-RS Library that can be accessed by third party clients. Your API should be exposed as URI endpoints.

•	A system for the local moneylenders allows customers to take out one loan. Customers pay back the loan in deposit amounts when they can and deposit date (can be a String for convenience) and amount should be stored in the system. The loan itself requires a description of why it is being taken out along with the loan amount to be stored. User info in the system is name, phone number, address and annual salary.

•	Marks will be awarded for: 

o	correct modelling of the objects

o	correct usage of JPA

o	the creation of a RESTful web service that enables access to the underlying database

o	manipulation of the objects including CRUD operations
